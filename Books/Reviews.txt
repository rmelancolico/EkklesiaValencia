-THE LION HAD BECOME A SHEEP
BY ASSOCIATION.
-LASTING CHANGE CAN OCCUR ONLY WHEN IT
TAKES PLACE IN THE SPIRIT OF THE MIND.
	-  I suddenly under-
	stood that lasting change could occur only when it took
	place in the spirit of the mind. Without this metamorphosis,
	no amount of training, study, or education could transform
	a follower into a leader.
	-  In essence, a converted attitude is
	the key to a transformed life

A DECISION AFFECTING THE FUTURE
	- Just as the young lion’s genuine growl revealed his
	  inherent strength, you can release the inherent leader-
	  ship strength within you when you come to understand
	  your true self.
        - you have to evaluate your past and
	  your potential and step toward one or the other
	- he would
	  have to give up the safe, secure, predictable, and simple
	  life of the farm and enter the frightening, wild, untamed,
	  unpredictable, dangerous life of the jungle, you will have
	  to leave the safe confines of being a follower if you are
	  going to become a leader

THE POWER OF ATTITUDE
	- There is nothing as powerful as attitude. Attitude
	  dictates your response to the present and determines the
	  quality of your future. You are your attitude, and your
	  attitude is you. If you do not control your attitude, it will
	  control you
	- The difference between a leader and a follower
	  is attitude.

ATTITUDE CREATES YOUR WORLD AND
DESIGNS YOUR DESTINY
	- “the mind-set or mental conditioning that determines
	  our interpretation of and response to our environments.”
	  It’s our way of thinking
	- In essence, your attitude is the manifesta-
	  tion of who you think you are.
        - We live our lives based on who we think we are.
	- Your leadership development
	  is determined by your perceptions of who you are and why
	  you exist—in other words, your sense of significance to life.
