-THE LION HAD BECOME A SHEEP
BY ASSOCIATION.
-LASTING CHANGE CAN OCCUR ONLY WHEN IT
TAKES PLACE IN THE SPIRIT OF THE MIND.
	-  I suddenly under-
	stood that lasting change could occur only when it took
	place in the spirit of the mind. Without this metamorphosis,
	no amount of training, study, or education could transform
	a follower into a leader.
	-  In essence, a converted attitude is
	the key to a transformed life

A DECISION AFFECTING THE FUTURE
	- Just as the young lion’s genuine growl revealed his
	  inherent strength, you can release the inherent leader-
	  ship strength within you when you come to understand
	  your true self.
        - you have to evaluate your past and
	  your potential and step toward one or the other
	- he would
	  have to give up the safe, secure, predictable, and simple
	  life of the farm and enter the frightening, wild, untamed,
	  unpredictable, dangerous life of the jungle, you will have
	  to leave the safe confines of being a follower if you are
	  going to become a leader

THE POWER OF ATTITUDE
	- There is nothing as powerful as attitude. Attitude
	  dictates your response to the present and determines the
	  quality of your future. You are your attitude, and your
	  attitude is you. If you do not control your attitude, it will
	  control you
	- The difference between a leader and a follower
	  is attitude.
	- Your attitude
	  about yourself has a tremendous impact on your daily life
	  and whether you fulfill your central life purpose

ATTITUDE CREATES YOUR WORLD AND
DESIGNS YOUR DESTINY
	- “the mind-set or mental conditioning that determines
	  our interpretation of and response to our environments.”
	  It’s our way of thinking
	- In essence, your attitude is the manifesta-
	  tion of who you think you are.
        - We live our lives based on who we think we are.
	- Your leadership development
	  is determined by your perceptions of who you are and why
	  you exist—in other words, your sense of significance to life.

DESIGNED TO LEAD OUR ENVIRONMENTS
	
THE HIDDEN LEADER IN YOU

NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE , YOU HAVE THE NATURE
AND CAPACITY FOR LEADERSHIP.

A NATURAL INSTINCT FOR LEADERSHIP

YOU WERE DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO
MANAGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT.

LEADERSHIP AND OUR BELIEFS ABOUT ORIGIN

GENERALLY, OUR IDEAS ABOUT LEADERSHIP
ARE CONDITIONED RESPONSES

WE ARE THE PRODUCTS OF A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT
AND CREATIVE SUPREME BEING.

MYTHS ABOUT LEADERSHIP

OUR PHILOSOPHIES DETERMINE
THE WAY WE THINK.
 - This issue is vitally important because our beliefs, con-
victions, and ideas form our personal philosophies and serve
as the source of our perceptions of ourselves and others, as
well as of life itself. In essence, our philosophies determine
the way we think.


Myth #1
Birth Trait Theory:
“Leaders are born, not made.”
- This philosophy results in our blocking our own
leadership potential and development and surrendering
our untapped leadership capacity to the control and limi-
tations of others.

Myth #2:
Leadership by Providence
- In essence, leadership is
reserved for the few chosen by a divine power to control
manage, and direct the life, future, fortunes, and aspirations
of the un-chosen.

Myth #3
Leadership Is the Result of
a Charismatic Personality
- This is the theory that only certain individuals who pos-
sess a unique measure of charisma; who exhibit special traits,
such as a force of will; who are extroverts; who are magnetic
speakers, and so on, are leaders. 

Myth #4
Leadership Is the Product of
a Forceful Personality
- This theory emerges from the belief that leadership is
the result of an authoritarian, coldly calculating, no-nonsense,
hard-driving, impatient, quick-tempered, and moody person-
ality

Myth #5
Leadership Is the Result of Special Training
- This is the belief that leaders are produced through spe-
cial educational courses and training.


WE SHOULD NEVER LET ANYBODY GET THE IDEA
THAT WE DON’T HAVE WILLS OF OUR OWN.
 - We have allowed circumstances, other people, and our
own unsubstantiated beliefs to block our natural leadership
tendencies.

IT’S ALL ABOUT ATTITUDE
- The essence of leadership, again, is not in techniques
for controlling and manipulating people, which seem to be
popular in leadership training today. 

THE ESSENCE OF LEADERSHIP IS NOT IN
TECHNIQUES; IT ’S IN OUR ATTITUDES.
 - True leadership is an attitude that naturally inspires
and motivates others, and it comes from an internalized
discovery about yourself.

“AS YOU THINK, SO SHALL YOU BE”
- Knowing changes your mind, which
transforms your attitude, which, in turn, informs, directs, and
regulates your behavior.
- another
generation heard a similar truth from King Solomon, the
wisest and richest man of his day, who essentially said, “As a
man thinks in his heart, so is he.”
- Most of us are not leaders today because, in our hearts,
we don’t believe that is who we are. 

THE LEADERSHIP SPIRIT AND
THE SPIRIT OF LEADERSHIP
- We were given the leadership spirit when we
were created. Our leadership potential is still intact, but we
have lost the spirit of leadership—that is, the consciousness
of our being made in the image of our Creator, as well as the
attitudes that accompany that awareness, which are the foun-
dation of true leadership.
- We still have the raw material of leadership potential, but
most of us don’t have the desire, courage, or will to use it as we
are meant to. 

ATTITUDE CREATES ENVIRONMENT
- they
influence their environments more than their environments
influence them.

TRUE LEADERS INFLUENCE THEIR ENVIRONMENTS
MORE THAN THEIR ENVIRONMENTS INFLUENCE THEM.
- True leaders strive to overcome crises, and they
become creative in difficulty

CAPTURE AND CULTIVATE
THE SPIRIT OF LEADERSHIP

YOU WERE BORN TO LEAD, BUT YOU
MUST BECOME A LEADER.

DISCOVER THE LEADER WITHIN YOU
