CHAPTER TWO										====== window size======
What Is a True Leader?
 - Leadership is the capacity to influence others through
inspiration motivated by a passion, generated by a vision,
produced by a conviction, ignited by a purpose.

LEADERSHIP IS MORE THAN INFLUENCE
- The fact is that true leadership is not control or manipu-
lation of others, but it is other people’s willful submission
of their authority to yours, motivated by inspiration.

A WORKING DEFINITION OF LEADERSHIP
- True leadership fundamentally requires the respon-
sibility of taking followers into the exciting unknown and
creating a new reality for them.

"Leadership is the capacity to influence others through
inspiration motivated by a passion, generated by a
vision, produced by a conviction, ignited by a purpose."


THE PRIORITY OF INSPIRATION
- the word leader is not a label that you give yourself
- Leader
is what the people whom you inspire call you because they
are stirred to participate in the positive vision that you
are presenting them—whether it is the vision for a coun-
try, a company, or a cause.
- The principal pur-
suit, therefore, for those who desire and aspire to become
effective leaders must be the answer to this question: “How
do I inspire and what is the source of inspiration?”
- If inspiration is the key to legitimate influence and
thus the source of true leadership, then, again, inspiration
should be the pursuit of all true leaders. How do leaders
inspire others? What is the source of inspiration? These
are the most important questions of leadership, and when
you have found the answer to them, then you will have
begun to discover your own leadership potential.


THE POWER OF PASSION
- Simply put, the source of inspiration is passion. This
component of leadership is the heart of influence and is
the generator of the energy and resilience of the leader.
- Passion is the discovery of a deep desire born out of a con-
viction that renders one possessed by commitment to a
purpose.
- True leaders, therefore,
are those who effectively express their inner passions,
which find a common response in the hearts of others.
It is passion that attracts people to the leader, who moti-
vates them to take action.
