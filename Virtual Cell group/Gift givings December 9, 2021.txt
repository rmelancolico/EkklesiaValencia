Giving Gifts

The highlight of this season is about giving.
Kita dapat ang mag hatag.

we are blessed by our God to bless others. Naa tay dapat e hatag

What kind of gift God can give you

1. He gives perfectly
      - pleasing
      - pina ka best
      - kung house and lot, no need na e renovate
      - pag dili perfect dili na from the Lord

2. He never withholds
      - kung para sa imo, para jd na sa imo, ang question lng kung ready kana ba?
3. He gives the desires of our heart
      - like a father is willing na magprovide sa mga gusto sa ilang mga anak mao pd si God.
      - He is very will be delighted to provide


What gift is this

John 3:16
 - eternal life!
 - a life of complete

the question now is are you willing to recieve the gift?
once willing ka mag recieve, ang imong ma recieve is complete package,
naa kay healing sa imong heart, naa restoration sa imong life (relationship nimo sa imong family). also Jesus Christ (the gift) is the only way to eternal life. that eternal life dili lng ma recieve at death but also while you are still here in the earth.
