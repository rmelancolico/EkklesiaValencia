RELFECTION

What form of test are you facing now? How will you stand firm against them?

Ever since I have decided to follow God, I always face constant testing.  Some testing came to as a surpise. There are times that I felt the silence of the God. And realize that like a student during exam,  the teacher is silent. 

On the greatest and continues testing in my life is the test in my faithfulness in my tithes. I am the type of person that have a stable job, but donâ€™t have stable income.  Most of the time, I only received a piece of paper on pay day.  I know that it desires obedience rather than sacrifice, and tithing is a command of God. I am afraid to disobey God. I am scared of losing the presence of God or being cut down.

Knowing this, I always pray to God to give me knowledge and wisdom so that I could generate income outside my works.  And to learn to prioritize things and to focus on the task needed to be done.  I am the kind of person that easily get distracted on things. And also, I will be changing my mindset, to work not to earn big, but to be able to give my tithes.
