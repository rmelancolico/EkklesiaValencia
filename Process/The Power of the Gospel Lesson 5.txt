The power of the gospel

1. It Redems
 - tanan na mga sala, mga gamay, mga dako, tanan sala, g redem na si cross of calvary
 - once na redem na ta, ayaw na balik. Lisod na mo ingon na na redem ta pero gapakasala dyapun na, lahi ang makita sa uban.

2. It renews
  - renew means to make a new again
    "The old is gone, the new has come"
  
3. It restores
  - tanan nakuba, nawala mabalik ra na cya, mga relationship na na daot, mga dreams na nawala ma balik na.

Romans 10:9-15
  - believe!

Starting today, what are the ways would take to share the Gospel
Sharing the Gospel is the most important task of a believer.  You are selfish if you won’t share the gospel. There are a lot of ways to share the Gospel and most of it does not require you to shred a sweat.

One of the ways I would do to share the gospel is through social media. I will not just share it on my timeline, but share it to a friends by messaging them verse. Also, I will keep on tagging my friends during the online church, and taking notes of the person who response and do a follow up. Another way of best using social media for sharing gospel is to continue my vlog. I have a YouTube channel where I post my take aways during our Sunday cell celebration, I will continue that.

Another ways, is that I should use more often the words “Praise God”, Thanks God”, “God bless you”. This is just simple words but it can give an impact to a person that I am talking.
