What Kind of temptation do you usually face? How would your overcome it now?

Online games! This is the temptation that I was facing and have overcome. Ever since I was in elementary I already love playing video games.  And it was during my college years that I was introduce to onlines games and got addicted to it. I spend more times in playing online games than doing my school works.

Even when I already have a work, I still play a lot of games. And then last year a Play-To-Earn online game was introduce.  I got even more addicted to it. At first I thought it was ok because I am earning, but it was been my greatest destruction not just to my work, but to my relationship with the Holy Spirit. My devo time was affected. My leader always instructed me to focus on what needed to be done for my minister, and I believe by listening to the instruction of my leader, I will overcome this temptation. I have also uninstalled all the online games in my cellphone, in my home computer and also in my office computer.  I will always pray and ask God that He will make me strong to stand firm, so that I would say yes to my temptation.
