From information to revelation and from revelation to transformation


What you have learned from the lesson about the Holy Spirit?

From the lesson about the Holy Spirit I learned that the Holy Spirit is a proof that God really keep His promises. The Holy Spirit is also the proof God’s love for us that He will never abandon us. Jesus already went up to heaven, but He asked God the Father to send to us the Holy Spirit.

Holy Spirit is also a person, meaning, He can be where ever I go. He is just like a best friend but more than that. Just like a best, I should have a good relationship with Him. To level up my relationship with the Holy Spirit, I should spend time to Him. There are things that I don’t understand or I think I understand in my devotional time.  Sometimes during my devotional it seems like I am only reading a novel, or a history.  But with my relationship with t he Holy Spirit, things that are hidden will be reveal. The deeper my relationship with the Holy Spirit, the better the revelation in my devotional time. As a first class disciple, I should value my relationship with the Holy Spirit.
