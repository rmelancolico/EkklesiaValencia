CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Attitude #8
Persistence

- As a leader it is important to have or to cultivate the attitude of persistence

What is Persistence
 - according to google persistence is the firm or obstinate continuance in a course of action in spite of 
   difficulty or opposition

 - when we walk our faith and our divine duty, it is not smooth sailing, we will face difficulties 
   and especially opposition, and most of the times, rejections
 - Now, The spirit of leadership never gives up until it achieves its goal.
 - It is a spirit that never quits
 - Being persistence is powerful, that even you dont have talent, you will be successful
 - Jesus told a parable about persistence, it is the parable of a widow seeking justice

How to be persistence?

1. Focus on your vision
   - in Habakkuk 2:2-3 ESV - And the Lord answered me: Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so he may run who reads
     it. For still the vision awaits its appointed time; it hastens to the end—it will not lie. If it seems slow, wait for
     it; it will surely come; it will not delay.
   - this is why we write our list of 12 sa atong mga notebook ug naa tay mga vision board
   - hapit na pd ang December, ting himo na pd nato ug vision board
   - each one of us receive visions. 
   - and that vision is very achievable. kaya ra nato na, kay dili man kita ang nag butag sa ato ana, ang atong Lord man
   - 
2. Learn from your mistakes
   - in doing are purpose, along the way dili jd nato malikayan na tay mistake na mahimo
   - pero mistake should not be a reason na mo stop ta, na mo give up ta.
   - Successful people keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don’t quit. -Conrad Hilton
3. Focus on your purpose
   - 
   - persistence is the product of faith that is generated by a purpose
   - unsa man jd ang imong purpose?
   - now if you have a deep conviction sa imong purpose, and you keep your focus to it,
   - i tell you, inspite of everything na ma agi-an nimo, you will hold on to your purpose
   - bahala unsa kakapoy, unsa na ka busy nimo, pero dili nimo mabati ang imong kakapoy kay tungod naka focus ka sa imong
     purpose
   - bahala lisod, pero you will keep on pushing, kay tungod kabalo naman ta na the victory is ours, everything has
     already won in the Cross of Calvary, all we need to do is to keep focus

 - naa koy experience recently about aning keep on asking, keep on seeking, keep knocking.
 - for so many months cgig ko panga apply  ug online
 - kapili ko ug send ug applications,
 - everyday ga hulat ko sa onlinejobs.ph for new job posting
 - then naa nag interview sa ako, pero ang g ingon lng sa ako, "cgi e add ka nako sa list of participants"
 - na abot ang time na medyo na discourage nako, medyo lng ha,
 - to the point na nag hunahuna ko na mangita nlng ko ug business
 - pero ang problem is that wala koy pang capital, so balik lng dyapun ko sa onlinejobs.ph
 - then one day dayon, naa nag email sa ako "hello, are you still looking a new role? you might consider applying"
 - so nag reply ako ug yes. nag schedule cya for an initial interview pero conflict cya sa schedule sa macro
 - God's favor, gsugot sila na e move ang initial interview on Friday at 1am
 - another God's favor noh ang intitial interview nahimo nang final interview
 - pero naka face ko ug problem, 
 - gi ask ko nila if maka work pa ko during 12midnight to 8am, kay mao man ang ilang working hours
 - which is conflict sa dawn prayer, and naka focus man ko na ma equip ko always sa Dawn Prayer
 - nag ingon ko sa ila na No, i cant work during that time
 - Ug dri ko na amaze jd sa Ginoo, ako ang gpapili nila what time ko mag duty, 
 - so nag ingon ko na 10pm - 1am or 2am, then 9am to 2pm, which is sugot sila
 - then nahuman mi ug interview is around 3am na, 
 - so naghulat nlng dayon ko sa dawn prayer, after dawn prayer ayha nako natulog
 - Pag mata nako aroung 1pm November 1, nag email na dayon sila sa ako ug contract
