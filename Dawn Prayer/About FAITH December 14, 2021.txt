The Presence of God is my inheritance

- dili tanan tao maka access sa presence ni God, and always remind yourself with that and enjoy the moment.

- dapat naa ang saktong attitude sa pag sulod sa presence ni God
- in the presence of God tanan gina timpla tanan sa imong life, break through, promotion, tanan nimo needs, family restoration, increase sa imong ministry (and with incrase in your financial)
- Everything can only be found in the presence of God

Hebrew 11:6
  - without faith you can pleased God

things in my life that i want to grow in 2022

The most very important thing you need to grow in 2022 is your faith, because everything can start in faith

faith is the only way that man can relate with God, and its only faith that God can relate with man

if we have faith, it will not hard for us to obey
faith is design that we obey God even though we dont understand God.
We sometimes obey on things that we understand, we have calucated every move, but faith is not design on that.
when we obey, there should not have condition
kay kung mag ober ka lang sa imong ma sabtan, daghan ka mahimong rason.

Mark 5:
- about lack of faith
- if you lack in faith, God can no longer perform any miracle


1. be clear with what you really want to happen on 2022
     - be clear!
     - ayaw pag nga nga
     - kay kung kulang ang clearity sa imong gusto, mas dako ang purohan na mawala ka kang Lord kay wala man ka klaro, blur man ka! dapat may focus ka
     - how  to make it clear: set goals

2. count the cost
     - everything came with a cost.
     - if you want your faith to increase, it will come with a cost, one of it is disicpline.
     - higher level, you need to pay higher:
        like if you want to increase your prayer time, we need to sacrifice naa jd time nimo sa uban na ma sacrifice. this is a principle and we need to know that.
     - if want your financial to increase, sacrifice your wants and do more with needs, save rather than expense.

3. beware of your weak points.
     - kanang asa ka dapat dali ma ilad.
     - Hebrew 12:1
     - bring you weak points at the feet of the cross
     - our weak points are like a broken wall of our life. and because of that dali ra ta ma sudlan sa mga sala. but remember broken wall if not design to remain broken forever, it must be restores. we need to work to repair it, lets bring it at the feet of the cross and apply the blood of Jesus
