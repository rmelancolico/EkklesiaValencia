Isaiah 61:7 - Instead of your shame
    you will receive a double portion,
and instead of disgrace
    you will rejoice in your inheritance.
And so you will inherit a double portion in your land,
    and everlasting joy will be yours.


The power to make decisions is the most significant gift of God

in baking, there is ingredients and instruction. God give us ingredients in our life and a instruction to produce something good. Everything in our life are provided, the thing we all need to do, is to use the ingredients properly and to follow the instruction

you dont need to invent life, you dont need to live with trial and errors. God wants us to follow the instrucion, just like written in Joshua, maditiate on it. 

Ang tanong, ano decision mo this 2022 (a year of double portion): will you folllow your own instruction, or are your follow God's instruction
