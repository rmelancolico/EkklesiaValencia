Prayer defeats pride
Fasting defeats lust
Giving defeats greed 

Fasting and giving:
1. Bind the flesh
2. build up your spirit
3. Breakthrough in my Life

Fasting is our way of biblically humbling ourself and prayer is a way of saying that you need God

dont make excuses, make fire

I will be like Jacob, you exchanges bowl of soup for blessing
Not like Esua who traded blessing for a bowl of soup

Prayer and fasting and giving, will ignite my supernatural. For this season of prayer and fasting, I will add giving to it. Not just in my financial or material, but in my time. I will give more time sa akong secret place. This is my time to build fire and not excuses.
Consecration is important for my supernatural. The deeper my relationship with the Holy Spirit, the deeper my consecration will be. This year, I will be going through the war, and i need to prepare for 40 days
