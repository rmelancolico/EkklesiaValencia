REFLECTION:

Prayer is the most powerful weapon that every Christian should have. But it is only powerful and effective when it is done in the right. We need to be convince that we are praying to our heavenly Father who is the source of everything and whose love is unmeasurable. He is more willing to provide everything we need and what we want. We should have the confident that when we pray, He will surely answer. Our confident will be directly influence by our relationship with our Heavenly Father. The deeper our relationship the bigger our confident. A prayer without confident is weak, it is full of doubt. Since we have this confident, we should pray in whatever situation we will be. Our obedience to His Word will be a key to our effective prayer. We should operate according to His Word. When we do what we hear, our eyes will be open on what we need to pray for. Operating in God's Word will make our prayer powerful. We should do what we have heard.
