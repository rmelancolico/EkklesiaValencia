Eph 4:30

3 things that can offend the Holy Spirit

1. Disobedient to the Word of God
 -delayed obediance is still disobedience
 -when the Holy Spirit speaks to you, dont treat as a suggestion. The Holy Spirit is giving you instruction for you to obey.
 - the moment that God will speak to you, thats the perfect time to obey Him

2. Spiritual Apathy
  - lack of passion 
      passion is a lifestyle that you can choice
      lack of passion is a choice

   - what is spiritual apathy
      = dili mag devo kung dili ganahan
      = during dawn prayer, ga tanga ka lng sa screen while others are praying
      = during giving, wala ka ga give
      = lack of engagement

3. un godly compromises
      = kanang mga ginagmay nimo na jokes na dili ungodly
      = sa imong mga pag sasalita, the using of ungodly words/expression (yots, etc)
      = online seller ka pero ang imong gna baligya dili mao.
      = ga hatag ka ug mga gift/bribe na mga ungodly (tanduay, etc)
  dapat mag careful ta sa mga ungodly compromises
