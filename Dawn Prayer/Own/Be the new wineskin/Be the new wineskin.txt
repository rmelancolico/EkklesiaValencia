greetings

Mark 2:22 NIV
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins.”

e story ang process sa wine making sa una	

What is fermentation

unsa kagahitabo sa new wine sa pag butang wineskin, mag ferment cya

   The comparison is a very apt one when we think of the properties of wine and wineskins. When wine is new, it is in a state of fermentation. It bubbles and expands as the fermentation gases are released. A fresh, pliable wineskin can absorb such expansion and slowly age-with the wine until the fermBeentation process is complete.


Understanding the symbols
1. Old Wineskin - our old self. katong before ta naka sinati kang Jesus
2. New Wine - Spirit na g sulod sa wineskine or gsulod sa imong kaugalingon
3. New Wineskin - the new  you
