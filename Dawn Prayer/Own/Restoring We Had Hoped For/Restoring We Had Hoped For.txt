Restoring What We Had Hope For

All of us receive a promise from God
And we hope for this to come.

Luke 24:13-15

1. Remove doubt
   - its common for us ang saying na "to see is to believe"
   - Thomas - Unless I see the nail marks in His hands (John 20:24-29)
   - doubt is a sign f kulang ka ug faith
   - specially doubting the testimony of others
   - in verse 22- 24 nag doubt sila about sa mga testimony sa ilang kauban na mga babae ug sa uban na mga kauban nag nag adto sa tomb
   - pero in verse 25 gi rebuke sila ni Jesus saying,  “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets  
     have spoken!

2. Know the Words of God
   - after gi rebuke sila ni Jesus, e explain ni Jesus ang scripture sa ila 
   - in verse 27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures 
      concerning himself.

   - Importance of knowing the Words of God
        - The Word Of God Trains Us - 2 Timothy 3:16-17
            - All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,               
              correcting and training in righteousness
            - the Word of God will help us be prepared para sa mga promise of God
        - The Word Of God Directs Us  - Psalms 119:105 
            - Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.
            - naay mga ways para makuha nato ang mga promises ni God sa ato
            - not all blessings are from God
            - naa mga butang abi nato sakto, pero its a trap diay

   - dapat naa tay conviction everytime na mag devo ta, dili dapat devo kay tungod requirements ug para naa kay ma topic sa
     sa dawn prayer ug noon prayer. Amen ba?
3. Share your testimony
   - in verse 33-34 They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, 
     assembled together and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.” Then the two told what had 
     happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.
   - There is power in your testimony.
   - it is a confirmation na nag come true ang mga promises ni God sa imong life

4. Remember that you are not alone
   - naa kay ma doolan na spiritual family. 
   - in times na mag doubt ka, ang solution ani is to be transparent ka sa imong leader. 
   - wala ta kabalo, basin diay ang imong g.agian nimo na agi.an na sa imong mga kauban sa network
   --- in verse 36 While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with   you.”
