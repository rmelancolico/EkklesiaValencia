Why we need to to walk with the Holy Spirit

1. Its a rough road up ahead
2. Constant change 
   - we need to be dynamic, different people, different approach.

John 11:9-10 NIV
[9] Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world’s light. 
[10] It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.”

1. Remember the truth in you - unsa na ang truth na ang inyong dawatan sa Lord
			     - you know the truth, which is the truth about Jesus. 
			       which revealed through the Holy Spirit
			     - It is not enough na know the Jesus on a knowledge level lng
                               (He is God, He died in the cross and on the 3rd day He rose), dapat in experience 	                       level jd in a personal
	                        level
                             - also remember that you are called,
                             - remember that you are anointed
			     - more importantly remember that God loves you
	                     - dili ka niya pasagdan


2. Join the conquest - do not be left behind sa mga lihuk sa church, dapat mo sabay ta. 
		     - The light is always moving! sabay sa light
                     - sa time ni Jesus, always on the move Siya
                     - Where Jesus is, there is supernatural
		     - Believe and Go!
                     - walk your faith
		     - once you receive your calling, do something to fulfill it, wag maging paasa gaya ng Ex mo


3. Dont work in darkness - we all know the passage in the bible warning us not to grieve the Holy Spirit, dba?
			 - importante na kanunay ta mag lakaw na dala nato ang kahag
                         - isa sa maka pasubo sa Holy Spirit is our secret sins
			 - ginagmay na secret sins pero kanunay, 
			 - kani bitaw ginabuhat nimo na wala nimo gina inform imong leader, mao jd na ba
                         - bahalag ginaagmay pero kanunay sa kadugayan mo dako ni, one thing will lead to another
