Life Style
1. Daily Offering
  how great is our God? if you understand this, you will know the true meaning of offering.
  Isaiah 6: my earth is my foot stand
  - your life should be a daily offering, meaning, everyday you need to do something for God
  - offer your heart to God daily
  1 Cor 6:19-20
   - a life offered to God is a life surrendered to God
  Romans 12:1

  Kita tanan gusto na everyday ma on fire ta, the question is, are you willing to offer your life exchange for fire? gusto ka ug on fire pero walay offering, walay devo, walay prayer life, dili ka engage sa team expectator lng. unsaon nimo ang fire kung dili nimo gamiton?
  no offering, no sacrifice, no fire

  sa story ni Elijah, g consume sa fire ang iyang offering. now if you want to be on fire, you need an offering

2. Do it daily

 - check your motive, basin lahi na ang imong motive. ma sayang ang imong effort kung lahi ang imong motives
