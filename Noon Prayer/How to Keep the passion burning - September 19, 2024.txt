Good noon sa tanan, for todays topic, ill be sharing some of my take aways
sa libre na Spirit of Leadership by Myles Munroe

In this Book ge define ni Myles ang leadership as:

Leadership is the capacity to influence others through
inspiration motivated by a passion, generated by a
vision, produced by a conviction, ignited by a purpose

- leadership is about influencing others through inspiration
- ang pangutana karon is  How do I inspire and what is the source of inspiration?
- inspire ka kang kinsa man? or unsa man?
- unsa ang imong source sa imong inspiration?
- sa book ni Myles Munroe g mention niya na na source of inspiration is PASSION
- everyone type in the comment PASSION
- what is passion: passion is the discovery of a deep desire born out of a 
  conviction that renders one possessed by commitment to a purpose. 
- so as a leader dapat naa kay passion, 
- true leadership passion is the discovery of a belief, reason,
  idea, conviction, or cause not just to live for, but also
  to die for,
- True leaders, are those who effectively express their inner passions,
  which find a common response in the hearts of others.
- para effective ta to express our passion, you need first to keep the passion burning
  lisod nimo e express ang imong passion kung ga aso lng ni, dapat ga dila-ab imong passion
- for this noon prayer i will share 3 points on how to keep the passion burning

How to Keep the passion burning

Failing to discover or pursue your personal leadership
potential will deprive your generation and succeeding
generations of your unique and vital contribution to the
world.


1. Have a clear vision of your PURPOSE
 Passion comes from purpose

2. Keep the Focus
 - Nehemiah
 - Rebuilding the wall became his purpose
 - because sa iyang burning desire to rebuild the wall
 - ang

 -  “I am doing a great work.
Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down
to you?”

  - in Jesus, ministry, daghan ang na heal niya.
    pwd man unta to na dili cya mo adto sa cross to keep on healing
    para daghan pa cya miracle mahimo
  - pero dili mao ang Iyang Purpose. Iyang purpose was to defeat once for all
    the forces of evil. 


3. Keep Going
 - CONVICTION ABOUT YOUR LIFE PURPOSE LEADS
   YOU TO KEEP GOING IN THE MIDST OF OBSTACLES.
 - Just keep going
 - dili smooth sailing ang tanan, once you are convince ug nay conviction,
 - like sa life ministry ni Paul
