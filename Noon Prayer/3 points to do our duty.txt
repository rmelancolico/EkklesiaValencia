Good noon everyone,

- for todays episode, i will be sharing an insight na nakuha nako sa ministry ni John the Baptist
- sa baby pa si John, gi declare na sa iyang papa kung unsa ang iyang ministry
- ang ingon sa papa ni John sa first chapter of the gospel of Luke:
- will be called a prophet of the Most High
- for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for Him
- to give His people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins
- to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death
- to guide our feet into the path of peace.

- i believe noh na mao ning ginabuhat nato karon in the present days?
- we are preparing the way for Jesus na hapit na mo balik
- we are becoming a light to those who are in the darkness
- and sa Luke 3, diha jud nag start ang ministry ni John
- in Luke 3:4-6 
  As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. And all people will see God’s salvation.’”


- sa atong pag believe and go, run the race with fire and with urgency we are the doing the ministry that is prepared for us, long time ago
- kinsa mo agress sa ako? pataas ang isa ka kamot ug isa ka tiil
- im sure kita tanan naa dri nag response sa atong divine calling.
- kita tanan nag do sa atong duty..

sa Luke 3:4-6 naa koy nakuha na tula ka points and this is what i want to share for this noon prayer. Are you ready?

The first is "make straight path"
- in doing are duty dya sa Ginoo, there are ways that seems right for us.. pero dili diay
- abi nato its a short cut, but it ended up dili diay, samot na hinoon nadugay
- thats why na always ta dapat na naay attitude or characteristic of RFATS na leader
- transparent ta dapat sa atong leader, kay basin ways nato na ginaagin is dili na mayo
- the phase make straight path talks about strategy, comment below strategy
- we should follow the right strategy that are leader has set
- like sa PIC dapat with in 24-48 hours.
- dapat maka experience ang mga VIP ug belongingness and many more na mga effective and test strategry

The second points that i want to share "Every valley shall be filled in"
- while walking the straight path, at first it maybe seems not right, or sometimes maka ingon ta na dili effective
- sometimes maka ingon ta ba na, g awat naman nako ang ginabuhat sa akong leader, g follow naman nako cya
  pero ngano wala naman na response ang akong list of 12?
- naka feel ba mo in.ani? sa ako sa una, na feel ni nako. Gi awat naman nako ang strategy sa akong leader
- gi PIC na nako with 24 hours, pero wala man dayon
- now this kind of thoughts will lead us to discouragement and then to doubt
- now discouragement and doubt will arise when there is a little faith
- if you wont able to fill your self with faith, mag lisod ta sa pag do sa atong duty
- our duty will just become a burden sa ato. it because of lack of faith. 
- and the only way to fill our faith is to pray. shout it to the Lord
- sa ingon sa mga disciple kay Jesus na, Lord increase our faith. 
- ask and it shall be given


The third point i want to share is "every mountain and hill made low"
- dont take this litaral ha, but there is a way to make the mountain and hill low.. how?
- is through persistent and perseverance
- we all know that climbing a mountain is hard and very kapoy, specially if first time nimo mag climb
- in our journey in doing our job, naa jud nay ups and down, mo abot ang times that it seems we are climbing a
  mountain
- kapoyon ta, and its normal
- but if we are going to be persistent sa atong ginabuhat, sa atong strategry ug mag persevere,
  mo abot jd na ma conquer na ato ang mga mountains
- kung always nato gna saka ang isa ka bukid, mo abot ang time na maka ingon ta na, dili man diay taas ni na bukid
- one strategy that we could easily climb a mountain is through training!
- naa koy kaila sa una, na before sila mo climb of mountain for the first time, mag prepare na sila, mag training
- months before the climb, mag jogging na na sila, mag prepare na sa ilang mga gears.
- like pd sa ato, before na mag conquer or mag harvest naa man tay ginahimo na preparation, dba?
  unsa man ni na preparation? prayer and fasting, and mentoring


so right now, kung ika naka fill ug kapoy, or any discouragement kay wala nag response sa imong invitation, or naay doubt, bisan gamay na right, i want you to bow down our heads ang close your eyes
- and ask for strength and surrender to our God, every discouragement and doubt, and ask Jesus to increase your faith
- lets pray to God and ask, ang promise ni God sa ato na ask and it should be given
- .......

- lets also pray for a revival fire
 - in our hearts
 - in our marriages and families
 - in your network
 - in the whole Church
 - in your simbalays, communities and macros, (mention! mention!)
 - in our region and nation
 - in campuses, government and private agencies
 - revival with signs and wonders, healing and miracles
