The Spirit of Leadership

[introduction]
 my reading about the book Spirit of Leader

- each of one of us was design to become a leader.
- during the creation in Genesis time, man was created by God in His image and in His likeness
- and in all of the creation that God has made, only mane were created in the image and likeness of God
- ug tungod ani, being made in His image means having the spirit of leadership
- in Genesis 1:28, mao ning ang first command ni God para sa mga tao. it says in that passage: Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.
- thus, it is expected of us to lead
- but in reality wala jd nato na fulfill nato ang atong design
